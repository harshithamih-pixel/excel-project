# Bike Buyers Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of over 1,000 customer records to explore the behavioral and demographic patterns associated with bicycle purchasing. The dataset includes various attributes such as marital status, gender, income, children count, education, occupation, home ownership, number of cars owned, commute distance, region, age, and whether the customer purchased a bike.

## Dataset
The data consists of multiple sheets listing customer profiles and key derived metrics:
- **bike_buyers**: Raw customer records with detailed demographics and purchase status.
- **WORKSHEET**: Enhanced dataset with age brackets.
- **PIVOT TABLE**: Aggregated views showing relationships between purchase behavior and variables like income, gender, age, commute distance, and car ownership.

## Key Insights & KPIs
1. **Income and Gender:** Bike buyers generally have higher average incomes than non-buyers, with males showing a stronger income effect on purchase.
2. **Commute Distance:** Short-distance commuters (0-1 miles) have the highest bike purchase counts, with 2-5 mile commutes also significant.
3. **Age Brackets:** Most purchases are from middle-aged individuals, followed by adolescents and older age groups.
4. **Car Ownership:** While income rises with the number of cars owned, many bike purchasers own 0 or 1 car, indicating bicycles as primary or complementary vehicles.
5. **Age Distribution:** Peak buying ages cluster around early middle age (e.g., ages 36, 37, 38).

## Visualizations
The project includes pivot tables and summary charts:
- Average income by gender and purchase status.
- Bike purchase counts by commute distance.
- Purchase distribution across age brackets.
- Income trends relative to car ownership, split by gender.
- Age-wise detailed purchase counts highlighting key age groups.

## Tools & Methods
- Data cleaning and feature engineering for creating age brackets and summarized KPIs.
- Pivot tables to aggregate and analyze data segments.
- Descriptive statistics for income and purchase behavior.

## Usage
- The dataset and analysis are ideal for exploring consumer transportation preferences.
- Can be extended to predictive modeling for bike purchase likelihood based on demographics.
- Suitable for portfolio presentation with clear visual summaries and structured insights.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analytical walkthrough from raw data to actionable marketing and product insights regarding bike buyers. It highlights how data visualization and pivot-based summaries can uncover meaningful trends in consumer behavior.
